Is there any particular reason inn biomimicry to satd as an ivory tower ?

I can't intelligibly understand the purpose of a practice who claims to be field "Insp√Æration from nature to solve humans problems" if it encloses itself in systems inherited from toxic paradigms. Perhaps this is deliberately to come out of it the best of a market with strong financial potential. The smell of a new juicy market, which would seem more green than green washing, stirs guardians of the tower that "functions as an exclusive club whose membership is tightly controlled by what can be called A "dominant model" [Patricia Braodfoot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricia_Broadfoot).

At the beginning of the 20th century, the principles of hybridization of cultural universes and practices by Otto Herbert Schmitt example led to the name and clarification of the term biomimicry to describe an exploration mode of Nature as a source of efficient & less costly solutions faces to lot of issues. Then the "deep" question of what nature is ultimately was treated by [Freya Mathews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freya_Mathews). More recently, starting in 1998, there are three basic principles of biomimicry, as defined by Janine Benyus:

* "Nature as a model" is the poetic principle of biomimicry, it tells us how things must be "brought into the world".

* "Nature as a measure" is the ethical principle of biomimicry, it tells us that nature imposes limits or ethical standards on what it's possible for us to accomplish.

* "Nature as a mentor" is the epistemological principle of biomimicry, for it argues that nature is the source of truth, wisdom, trial and error are essential aspects of innovation.

## Open source biomimicry ?

It would be somewhat unclear concept for a "movement" of the green revolution, through knowledge aimed at reconciliation with the biosphere, to copy systems that are not peer-to-peer and patented.

While biomimicry in France, and more widely in Europe, the question of ethics is too often dealt with in depth, there are nevertheless initiatives that are nascent and teem, diffuses but often not very interconnected.

If the first observation on this same practice of biomimicry has not (yet) arise equivalents to Meredith Patterson, Aaron Swartz, Critical Ingineering Manifesto, Open Source Ecology, and others, is not yet a fatality because We have the opportunity not to let biomimicry intoxicate itself by our carelessness. We could work on post-consumer efficiency by understanding a "systemic toxicity of commercial propaganda" and we could bring conditions for a new paradigm coherent with biomimicry.
