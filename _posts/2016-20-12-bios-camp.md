Is there any particular reason inn biomimicry to satd as an ivory tower ?

I can't intelligibly see teh purpose of a practice who claims to be field "Ins√Æration from nature to solve humans problems" if it encloses itself in systems inherited from toxic paradigms. Perhaps this is deliberately to  come out of it the best of a market with strong financial potential. The smell of a new juicy market, which would seem more green than green washing, stirs guardians of the tower that "functions as an exclusive club whose membership is tightly controlled by what can be called A "dominant model" (Patricia Braodfoot).
